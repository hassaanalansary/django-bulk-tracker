Installation
============

Installing django-bulk-tracker is simple and straightforward. First of all, you need a copy of Auditlog on your system. The easiest
way to do this is by using the Python Package Index (PyPI). Simply run the following command:

``pip install django-bulk-tracker``

Instead of installing Auditlog via PyPI, you can also clone the Git repository or download the source code via GitHub.
The repository can be found at https://github.com/hassaanalansary/django-bulk-tracker/.
